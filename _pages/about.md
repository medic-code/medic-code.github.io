I am Chief Medical Officer of AIBODY a digital physiology focused company at the intersection of education, clinical and research. Clinical Educator at University of Edinburgh and NHS Clinician in Geriatrics and General Medicine. 

My day to day is focused solely on bringing physiology to the front of medicine and beyond. I support startups, individuals in healthcare technology. I am passionate about the career transitions for medical doctors and teaching.

When I have time I write, and build interesting projects in the machine learning and web development space.
